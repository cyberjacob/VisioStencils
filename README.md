# VisioStencils

PRs welcome for new shapes/stencils and fixes to existing ones (e.g. adding connection points)

## Instructions
Download or clone this repo into `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Shapes` to use. Visio will automatically show all the stencils in the `My Shapes` section of the shape browser, no need to restart Visio. They will also be indexed for searching, however this may take Windows a little longer.
